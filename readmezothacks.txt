Inspiration:

Has your mom every told you that you couldn't go to McDonald's because "we have food at home?" You no longer need to fear the pickles and mayo at the back of your fridge, because the We Have Food at Home Recipe Finder/Meme Generator will take all the random ingredients lying around and find a delicious recipe for you!

What it does:

Just input up to 5 ingredients, and we will find up to 10 recipes containing those ingredients (and generate a meme for you).

How we made it:

We used JavaScript, CSS and HTML to create our project. We connected to the Edamam Recipe Database API to search for recipes containing the ingredients provided by the user.

Challenges we ran into:

It took a while for us to figure out how to take multiple inputs from the user, use it to search through data from the Recipe API, and then display that data for the user. We had to develop our HTML and JavaScript knowledge to solve this problem.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

We are proud that as a group we were able to collaboratively work and solve difficult problems we were faced with.

What we learned:

We all learned a lot about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Also, since this was the first Hackathon most of us have participated in, we learned how to work on big projects in a group using Repl.it and Github.

What's next for We Have Food at Home:

In the future we plan to expand our program to let the user search by calorie content and allergen items. We will also provide descriptions of each recipe when displayed to the user.
